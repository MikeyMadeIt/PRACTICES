### Practices – Python, Java and C

This repository contains my personal practice exercises in **Python**, **Java** and **C** as I continue learning programming. These simple programs help me understand the basics and improve my skills through hands-on coding.

### 📘 About

These are basic exercises I've written while learning:
- Variables and Data Types  
- Loops and Conditionals  
- Functions and Methods  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- File I/O  
- Recursion  
- API usage (for some Python exercises)

### 🐍 Python

### How to Run Python Files
Make sure Python is installed (`python --version` to check). Then:

```bash
python filename.py
```
---

### ☕ Java

### How to Run Java Files
Make sure JDK is installed (`java -version` to check). Then:

```bash
java Filename.java
```
---

### 🚀 Goals

- Practice coding consistently  
- Understand core concepts step by step  
- Build the foundation for advanced topics in CS  
- Gain confidence writing, reading, and debugging code

### 🧠 Notes

This is purely for learning. I'm not aiming for perfect code, but for **progress**. As I improve, I’ll revisit and refactor old code.
