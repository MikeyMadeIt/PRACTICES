### 📁 22 - VarArgs

This exercise demonstrates how to use **VarArgs (Variable-Length Arguments)** in Java. VarArgs allow methods to accept **any number of arguments** of a specified type, making your code more flexible and concise.

### 📚 What I Learned

- **VarArgs** (`type... name`) lets you pass multiple arguments into a method.
- Behind the scenes, VarArgs is treated as an **array** inside the method.
- Syntax: `double... nums` means the method can receive 0 or more `double` values.
- VarArgs are useful when:
  - You don’t know how many arguments you'll receive
  - You want to simplify overloaded methods
