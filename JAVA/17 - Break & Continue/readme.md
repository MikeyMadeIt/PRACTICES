### 📁 17 - BreakAndContinue

This exercise demonstrates how to use the **`break`** and **`continue`** statements in Java. These are used to control the flow of loops: `break` stops a loop early, while `continue` skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.

### 📚 What I Learned

- **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately when a condition is met.
- **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the code in the loop **only for that iteration**.
- Useful for:
  - Stopping once a target value is found
  - Ignoring specific values without ending the loop
