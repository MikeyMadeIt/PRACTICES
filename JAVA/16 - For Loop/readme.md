### 📁 16 - ForLoop

This exercise demonstrates how to use both the **traditional `for` loop** and the **enhanced `for-each` loop** in Java. It collects multiple numbers from the user, stores them in a list, then prints the values and calculates the average.

### 📚 What I Learned

- The **`for` loop** is used to repeat code a known number of times (like asking for input `n` times).
- The **enhanced `for-each` loop** is used to iterate through collections like arrays or ArrayLists.
- How to:
  - Store inputs in an `ArrayList`
  - Calculate average using a loop
  - Use `scanner.hasNextInt()` to validate number input
