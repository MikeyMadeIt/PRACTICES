### 📚 What I Learned

- **Method Overloading** means creating multiple methods with the same name but:
  - Different number of parameters
  - Different parameter types
- Java chooses the correct version based on the arguments passed when the method is called.
- Overloaded methods are useful when performing similar operations with slightly different inputs.
