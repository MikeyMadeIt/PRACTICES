### 📁 15 - WhileLoop

This exercise demonstrates how to use the **`while` loop** in Java. A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true, which is useful for input validation and repeating actions until a desired condition is met.

### 📚 What I Learned

- How the `while` loop works: it checks the condition **before** running the code block.
- It's useful when we don't know in advance how many times to loop.
- Common uses include:
  - Validating user input
  - Repeating a prompt until a valid response is given
- Use `scanner.next().charAt(0)` to read a single character from user input.
